# React_Native_biolerplate
 
 This project is a React Native boilerplate that can be used to kickstart a mobile application.

The boilerplate provides an optimized architecture for building solid cross-platform mobile applications through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic. It is fully documented so that each piece of code that lands in your application can be understood and used.

If you love this boilerplate, give us a star, you will be a ray of sunshine in our lives :)
